I recently graduated from LearningFuze Web Developement Bootcamp in Irvine, CA.  I am currently searching for a job in web developement after being in sales since I was 22.  I have always been intrigued by the latest technology or gadget and love to figure out how things work, so while I was still working in sales I had begun to teach myself how to code online at team tree house and code academy during the weekends and in my spare time, which eventually lead me to attend learningfuze's Full Immersion Web Developement Bootcamp .</p>
