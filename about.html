I am currently searching for a job in web developement. Since I can remember, figuring out how things work mechanically and how new technology is always evolving, has influenced my motivation and intrigued me. Being interested in the subject, I began my degree in computer science, but after the first couple years, outside circumstances lead me to start working full time in insurance sales. My grandfather, who was one of the main reasons I got into sales in the first place passed away after I had been working there for three years. At that point I decided that I wanted to learn more about my interests and went back to school. After I started taking programming courses at my local community college, it became apparent that what I was interested in learning was not offered in the manner or depth that I wanted to learn at. That is when I decided to take out all of my savings, humbly move back in with my parents to attend a full immersion web development bootcamp. This allowed me to learn an entirely new set of skills in a short period of time which will hopefully help jumpstart my career in web development.</p>
