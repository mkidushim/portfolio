I am currently searching for a job in web developement.  Since I can remember figuring out how things work and new technology has motivated and intrigued me.  So naturally I tried to get my degree in computer science but after the first couple years outside circumstances forced me to start working full time in Sales.  I had saved enough money up while working in sales to be able to go back to school but as I started taking programming courses at the local community college it became apparent that what I wanted to learn was not going to be taught or atleast not in the manner I was expecting.  That is when I decided to take out all of my savings, move back in to my parents and attend a full immersion web development bootcamp in order to help learn a new skill set as well as jump start my career in web development.</p>
