I am currently searching for a job in web developement.  Since I can remember figuring out how things work and new technology has motivated and intrigued me.  So naturally I tried to get my degree in computer science but after the first couple years outside circumstances forced me to start working full time in Sales. After 3 years in sales my grandfather who was one of the main reasons I got into sales in the first place passed away and at that point I decided that I wanted to go back to school. After I started taking programming courses at the local community college it became apparent that what I wanted to learn was not going to be taught or atleast not in the manner or depth I was expecting.  That is when I decided to take out all of my savings, move back in to my parents and attend a full immersion web development bootcamp in order to learn a new skill set and help start a new carreer in web development.</p>
